# Student-Management-System-
The Student Management System is a database-driven application designed to efficiently store, manage, and retrieve information related to students, their departments, and attendance records. It serves as a centralized platform for administrators and faculty to handle student data in an organized and secure manner.

The system supports essential functions such as adding new students, tracking attendance, managing department details, and user authentication. It ensures data integrity through proper normalization techniques and relational schema design.

Built on the XAMPP server using MySQL/MariaDB, the project follows DBMS best practices, including 1NF to BCNF normalization, ER to relational model conversion, and structured DDL queries.
